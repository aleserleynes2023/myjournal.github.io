            <h2>The Dance That Time Took Away</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I still remember the day she told me I was part of her 18 roses for her debut. That memory stays with me. 
                It was something meaningful something that made me feel special and seen by her. But I often find myself wondering 
                why fate didn’t give me the chance to actually dance with her.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Honestly, it feels like a looping nightmare… a moment that slipped through my fingers. 
                A missed opportunity that continues to haunt me. Sometimes, I wish I could relive that moment stand there in front of her, 
                hold her hand, and just be present in that once-in-a-lifetime dance. But time travel isn’t real, 
                and that’s when I feel myself drifting away from reality again.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                It feels like a Marvel theme like Captain America missing his dance with Peggy, the love of his life. 
                Now he’s a hero who has to save the world, carry the burden, fight the battles… but deep down, 
                all he ever truly wanted was to spend his life with her after the war. That quiet, simple dream. Just one dance. Just peace. Just love.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe the reason I keep hurting is because I hold on too tightly to a fantasy. 
                Maybe that’s been my biggest struggle clinging to the “what ifs” instead of grounding myself in what is. 
                I build entire worlds in my head where everything goes right, where love is easy and timing is perfect. 
                But life rarely plays out that way.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Still, despite everything, maybe what I wish for the most is this:
                <br>That when all the dust settles and our hearts find clarity…
                <br>We’ll have a stronger, deeper connection one that was worth the wait,
                <br>One that survived the storms,
                <br>And one that finally gets its dance.
            </p>
