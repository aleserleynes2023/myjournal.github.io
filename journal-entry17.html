                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Now that I think and reflect about it, maybe everything's really my fault. Everything that’s happening in my life it’s all going down. Every hobby I used to like, I have no energy for anymore. I can’t even do my responsibilities. And what's worse is the isolation. I guess no one cares about me anymore.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I always hate being at war with my mind. I fear every day what I don’t want to happen. And now I attracted what I fear the most ignorance. It’s my fault why everyone hates me. I let my anger get to me. I always let my emotions win. I let myself overthink the things that aren't even real. Now here I am again. I keep falling into the same old habits, and I’m trying my hardest to change.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                What’s choking me is the fact that I can’t cry anymore. I’ve let myself go downhill completely. I’ve lost myself. I’ve lost focus on my responsibilities, and I let anger take control of me. Now I’m just a disappointment, and it’s always my fault.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I disappointed my mother she doesn’t even want to look at me anymore. The woman I love I also disappointed her. She doesn’t want to talk to me anymore, nor has she seen my messages. I don’t know what to say anymore. Maybe I deserve this.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                When I was a kid, I always wanted to be a hero who'd save everyone. Now I ended up doing the opposite. And now I’m pretty sure I disappointed the child inside me too.
                All I want to say is sorry for everything. Maybe I don’t deserve to be in this world anymore... but who knows. I shouldn't be saying stuff like that. Maybe I just have to punish and ground myself. I’ll isolate myself and just be alone so that I wouldn’t end up hurting anyone else.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I'll keep myself grounded for now, until I finally learn to be more grateful and more peaceful with life and what it offers in the present for my family, love, and my friends.
            </p>
