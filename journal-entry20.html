            <h2>Space to Understand</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe we need this.<br>
                Maybe my love and I both need this space not to grow apart, but to grow separately for a while, to reflect, to understand ourselves better.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’m beginning to see what I’ve been turning into. I realize now how often I think about what I expect from others what I want them to give back, how I want them to understand me. But somewhere along the way, I forgot… I forgot that I need to understand her too.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                She’s human.<br>
                She’s probably going through battles I don’t even know about.<br>
                And I was so caught up in my own emotions that I failed to give her the patience, care, and space she might have needed all along.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’ve been selfish. Wanting everything to go my way, wanting all the answers, the attention, the comfort without realizing she needed the same. I’m sorry it took me this long to realize what a man should’ve known from the start.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But when the day comes if it does when everything settles and she comes back, I want to be ready. I want to do things right this time. I want to love with understanding, not pressure. With patience, not expectations. With gentleness, not emotional weight.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And with God’s help, with His Spirit guiding me, I’ll continue walking this road of healing. I’ll learn. I’ll change. I’ll be better not just for her, but for myself too.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And until then…<br>
                I’ll keep singing her songs.<br>
                Even if she doesn’t hear them now, maybe one day… she will.<br>
                And maybe she’ll still smile because of them.
            </p>
