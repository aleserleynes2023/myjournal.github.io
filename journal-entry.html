                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Today marks a day since I asked her for space. And honestly, it’s strange. There’s this quiet ache in me that hasn’t gone away. 
                I still feel like something’s missing like part of me is still reaching for her. But deep down, I believe stepping back is the right thing. 
                I need this time… to find myself again. To heal.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’ve been through a lot lately. I’ve felt weak, broken, and ashamed of not being as strong as I hoped I would be. 
                But each day, I keep pushing forward, even if it’s hard. There are thoughts in my head I can’t control clouds I can’t shake off. 
                I think I’m still searching for peace. And the truth is, I’m doubting myself more than I ever have.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Exams are approaching, and I don’t even know if I’m ready. Everything feels so heavy, and I’m exhausted physically, emotionally, spiritually. 
                I used to be able to count on myself, but lately, I just feel tired. Like the strength I once had is slowly fading.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                More than anything, I want to reconnect with God. I miss that part of me the one who found comfort and identity in faith. 
                I want to find myself again, through Him. Maybe that’s where healing will begin.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Despite everything, I still miss her. And despite every pain that lives inside me even those nights I cried over her I would still choose her. 
                Again and again. Because I really, deeply love her.
            </p>
