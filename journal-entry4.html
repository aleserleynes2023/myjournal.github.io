            <h2>A Love I Still Hold On To</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I still miss her the person I truly love, Alesia.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                From the moment I met her, something deep inside told me she was the one I truly wanted. 
                Not just for a fleeting moment, but for the kind of forever that people write songs and stories about. 
                And I knew, love isn't just about saying the words it’s about proving it through actions.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But whenever I hurt her, even unintentionally, it shattered me. It’s one of the worst pains to hurt the very person your heart beats for. 
                Whenever we had misunderstandings, all I ever wished for was a moment to talk things through. 
                Yet most of the time, I’m left confused, wondering what’s really going through her mind.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I ask myself the quiet questions:
                <br>Why can’t she reassure me sometimes?
                <br>Why can’t she send even just one reply?
                <br>Why does she always feel so distant, so busy?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                These thoughts hurt. They make me wonder if maybe she doesn’t value me as much as I hoped she would. 
                And on darker days, I spiral into asking if she’s already lost feelings… or worse was it just infatuation from the beginning?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But I can’t deny what I felt during the three months I loved her deeply those were some of the most joyful and hopeful days I’ve ever known. 
                Even now, through all these low points and moments of sadness, I still choose to continue. 
                Because I made a promise to wait for her… and I intend to keep it.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The truth is, I only fear one thing:
                <br>Is she scared to lose me too?
                <br>Or will she one day turn away like I never even existed?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe she’s the one I’ll marry.
                <br>Or maybe… she’ll become my greatest heartbreak.
                <br>But I remain faithful.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes when I reflect, I realize that much of this is just fear playing tricks on my mind. 
                You attract what you constantly fear. So now, I pray for peace. For a cleansed, quiet mind. 
                I pray to think positive thoughts because deep down, I believe there’s a reason why I felt this love for her. 
                It wasn’t random. It wasn’t meaningless.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And I’m not going to waste it.
            </p>
