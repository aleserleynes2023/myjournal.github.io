                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes when I think about it, there are things I deeply regret. I regret breaking my own boundaries just to make others happy. 
                I regret not listening to my instincts because somehow, I always end up regretting before I even fully understand the consequences of my actions. 
                But what’s done is done, and there’s no rewinding time. All I can really do now is try to reguide myself toward a better path… before it’s too late.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Lately, whenever I scroll through social media, I find myself dodging those love quotes the ones that whisper truths about red flags and heartbreak. 
                I skip past them quickly, because overthinking already hurts enough. But when I pause and reflect, it always brings me back to the same realization: 
                I regret expecting too much from others.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I expect them to give back the same energy I pour in, and when they don’t, it hurts. I expect to be understood, to be met halfway and when that doesn’t happen, 
                it always seems to end in conflict. I get disappointed, not because people fail me, but because I hoped too much.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And maybe… just maybe, that’s something I need to stop doing. Maybe I need to stop expecting and start accepting. People aren’t perfect. I’m not perfect. 
                And maybe forgiveness especially forgiving myself is the key to peace I’ve been looking for.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes silence really is the best response. Not in bitterness, but in healing. Because in the end, love shouldn’t need to be begged for or chased. 
                If someone truly wanted to, they would make you feel loved, enough, and appreciated… without you having to ask.
            </p>
