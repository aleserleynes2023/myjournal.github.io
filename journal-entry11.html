            <h2>Delivered, But Never Received</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                There she was active. My message got delivered. <br>
                Still… no reply. Not even a single word.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And just like that, everything inside me began to crack again.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I don’t even know how to explain what I’m feeling anymore in a way that makes sense. It’s like I’m watching myself fall apart in slow motion, helpless to stop it. I keep reaching out, holding on to the smallest hope, but every time I get no response, it feels like I’m being told without words that I don’t matter.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’m starting to fall back into that space I promised myself I’d climb out of. <br>
                And what hurts is that I’m not even angry. I’m just… exhausted. <br>
                Exhausted from hoping. From trying. From wondering if I ever meant something real.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes, silence screams louder than words ever could. <br>
                And tonight, that silence is deafening.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
