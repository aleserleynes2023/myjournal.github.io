                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I really love her, I really love Alesia. I just don’t know how to properly make her feel that she’s the girl I want to marry. I come to think of myself—I’ve been loving her too much. But I can’t keep hurting her. I can’t control my thoughts, my anger, my overthinking, my frustration. It saddens me that I have these qualities and storms in my head. I’m always a mess in a relationship. I really don’t know what I’m gonna do without her.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                If she’s gone, I’m never loving another one like her. Even if we don’t end up together, I’ll still love her silently and from afar. One day, if I’m about to die, she’ll be part of the life that flashes before my eyes.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Lord, please protect me… protect my thoughts. I don’t want to think of self-harm ever again.
            </p>
