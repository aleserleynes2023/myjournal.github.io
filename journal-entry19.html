            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Are my feelings valid?<br>
                Is there truly a reason why I’ve felt all of these things in just a few days waves of pain, loneliness, confusion and now I feel like I don’t belong anywhere? Like I’m just an outcast slowly drifting further away?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Ever since I began to isolate myself, I started to wonder… who would even notice? Who would check in and ask if I’m okay, or if something’s wrong? Maybe it’s selfish to expect that so I stay silent. I don’t bother anyone anymore… not even her.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I love her deeply, but whenever I try to explain what’s inside me, it just ends up messy. Telling the truth feels like lighting a fire. And maybe… being me has always been messy. That’s why I’m tired of opening up. I’m tired of making things worse just by being real.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                So maybe from now on, I’ll keep everything to myself.<br>
                If I have to walk alone, then I’ll walk alone.<br>
                If I have to grow alone, then I’ll grow alone.<br>
                Until the day comes when I can finally say I’ve learned how to live without needing to be understood.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But still… a small part of me hopes someone would understand anyway.
            </p>
