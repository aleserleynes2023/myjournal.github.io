            <h1>Welcome to My Personal Journal</h1>
            <p>
                Sometimes, the things I feel can’t be captured in voice messages or seen in photos. 
                So I built this space not as a masterpiece, but as a mirror. 
                A quiet place where my thoughts wander when the world is too loud, 
                and my heart needs somewhere to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where I lay down my thoughts and emotions. When my days feel heavy, 
                I come here hoping I can set them aside, even for a while. 
                And maybe… if someone reads them, I won’t feel so alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I always update new entries every time a random thought or emotion comes to my head 
                and I want to release it. The website only ends the day that I leave this earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Welcome, Alesia.<br>
                This space is yours too now. Please stay as long as you’d like.
            </p>
