            <h2>What I Carry Quietly</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I don’t really know how to express my feelings right now without sounding like I’m begging… or like I’m weak… or selfish. 
                But all I truly wish is that somehow, she could understand that all I seek is her support her quiet reassurance. 
                Just enough to calm the storms in my head, the ones I create when I doubt myself and overthink every little thing.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Lately, it’s been hard. The stress is overwhelming, and I’ve felt like I’m crumbling inside. And I know… I know I don’t have the right to say much. 
                She’s going through so much more living far away in California, handling the pressure of dentistry, and carrying her own burdens. 
                Mine might seem small in comparison.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But at the end of the day, all I’ve ever wanted was to be there to support her, to remind her she’s not alone. 
                And selfish or not, I long for the same. Just a simple hug. Just that one moment where things pause and everything feels okay, 
                even for just a little while. Maybe then, I’d start to feel okay too.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Even though I’ve lost a lot lately like our pet we adopted together, who I loved so much it still didn’t stop me from trying to give, 
                even when I had little. Despite financial problems, I still wanted to treat her with even just a simple libre pancit canton, 
                because that’s how much she mattered to me. And yet, here I am suffering, struggling silently, while everything feels like it’s slowly 
                falling apart around me. My life, and even my mental self.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I want to be the best man I can be for her, and for myself. But for now, I know I need to face this obstacle. 
                Maybe it’s here to teach me something. Maybe it’s helping me learn how to stay strong, even in silence.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Despite all the misunderstandings and all the times we might have hurt each other, all I want is a simple, honest deep talk to release these tears 
                and to hope that somehow, our souls will be okay again for each other.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Even after everything… despite the pain, despite the nights I cried over her I’d still choose her. Every single time. 
                Because when you truly love someone, that love doesn’t vanish with distance or difficulty. It just waits… quietly, faithfully.
            </p>
