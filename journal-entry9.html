                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                This coming week, I have to stay focused again. Exams are approaching, and honestly, I’m still doubting myself doubting if I can even pass. Everything feels so advanced lately, like I’m being thrown into deep water and told to swim alone. And the hardest part is knowing I’ve been struggling to count on myself, especially with how weak I’ve felt these past few days.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But even in the middle of that weakness, I’m still going to try.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Because deep down, I know my strength is starting to come back. The sun still shines brightly every time I wake up, and maybe that’s not just coincidence. Maybe it’s God reminding me that better days are on their way. I just have to be patient. I have to keep going. Try, and try harder.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I often think to myself whenever I feel like giving up I remember how far I’ve come. I’ve achieved so many things that others can’t, and sometimes I was just too blind to see it… blinded by my own thoughts turning against me. But even with that battle in my mind, I’m still here. I’m still standing.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’ll still try because I know I go through these things for a reason. I know God will give me what I need to keep going whether it’s strength in my lowest moments or recognition for the excellence I pour into everything I do.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe that’s what faith really looks like showing up for life even when it’s hard, even when no one claps for you, even when you're unsure of the outcome. I don’t need everything to be perfect. I just need to keep moving forward, one breath at a time, one step closer to the life I'm meant to live.
            </p>
