                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I often find myself getting angry easily sometimes over the littlest things, sometimes over the things I can't control, and especially when things don't go my way. I get frustrated when I don’t feel like myself anymore… the old version of me that was happy, strong, and free free to live without the pressure of expectations.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Now, I feel drained. These anxious, negative thoughts keep circling in my head like a storm I can’t escape. And I hate that I’ve become scared of myself of the way I let all this weight take control. Sometimes, I break down and lose control, and in the aftermath, all I see are the pieces I’ve shattered. It’s not just things I break it’s trust, peace, and even the reflection of who I thought I was.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                What hurts the most is the look on my mother’s face the disappointment I see when I act out. That look pierces deeper than any punishment. I cry silently afterward, not just because of guilt, but because I know I carry so many burdens and anxieties, yet I don’t know how to release them. I don’t know how to open up to the people I love. And even when I want to, I stop myself… because of that fear. The fear that maybe I’m too weak. That I’m becoming less of a man for not being okay.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’m losing parts of myself, piece by piece. And all I can do sometimes is cry alone, quietly, hoping no one sees the mess behind the mask.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But you know what I’ve been realizing lately?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes, what a hurting person really needs isn’t advice, or fixing, or even words.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes, they just need a hug a real, sincere hug. Maybe from God. Maybe from someone they love and trust. Maybe from family. Something that says, “You’re not alone.” Something that says, “I still love you, even with all the cracks.”
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Right now, I think I just really need that hug to let the tears fall, to feel understood, to feel seen.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Because maybe then, I can start healing again.
            </p>
