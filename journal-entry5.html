            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Every day, I still dream about her.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I find myself lost in these vivid, romantic moments with her soul dreams where we’re dating again, laughing, hanging out, 
                just being together like we used to. In those dreams, everything feels so real. So warm. So right.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But then morning comes, and the nightmare begins the kind where I open my eyes and realize it was just a dream. 
                That’s when disappointment sinks in like a heavy blanket. And I ask myself over and over… was that love never real? 
                Were those feelings just memories fading? Or maybe… are they visions of what’s to come premonitions of the life we’re meant to share?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes I wonder if I’m just holding on to a dream.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Still, I talk to God about her every single day. I pray for her protection, her strength, and her courage to keep going, 
                especially with everything she’s facing. I ask Him to guide her path and to remind her that someone far away is always cheering for her.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And I pray for myself, too not just for strength to endure, but so that one day, when the love of my life finally succeeds… 
                I’ll be right there beside her, having succeeded too. I hold on to that vision of us both rising above our struggles together. 
                Living the life we always dreamed of. Exploring the world hand in hand, laughing at how far we’ve come.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe it’s time I stop clinging to what’s only in my head and start anchoring myself in the present. 
                Maybe it’s time I stick to reality to face the war and walk the journey until I finally reach that chapter of my life 
                where I meet her in person, not in dreams, but in the quiet beauty of real life.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I believe in that future.<br>
                I pray that what I hope for… will one day become real.<br>
                Because deep down, I know it can.
            </p>
