            <h2>After the Storm</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The tears have finally stopped falling.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I don’t know if it’s because I’ve run out of them or because I’m slowly starting to breathe again. Maybe both. For the past few hours, I felt like I was drowning in every emotion I tried to suppress for too long anger, confusion, hurt, exhaustion. But right now, in this moment, there’s a little quiet in my heart. And maybe that’s enough for now.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe I just needed to break down to finally cool down.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                It’s strange how pain has a way of making everything louder your thoughts, your doubts, your fears. And then after all of that noise, when there’s nothing left, silence settles in. That silence… it doesn’t mean I’m okay. It just means I survived another wave. It means I’m still here.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’m starting to realize that even the strongest hearts need rest too.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Tonight, I’m not trying to fix everything. I’m not trying to understand why things turned out the way they did. I’m just allowing myself to rest in the fact that I cried, I felt, I shattered and now, I’m slowly beginning to pick up the pieces.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I still don’t know what tomorrow holds, but tonight, I’m proud I didn’t give up.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And if that’s not strength, I don’t know what is.
            </p>
