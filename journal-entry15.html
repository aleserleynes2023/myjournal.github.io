                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                A night before, I sent her voice messages of me singing just hoping, praying, that maybe, somehow, it could change everything. That it could reach the part of her heart that still remembers how we used to be. But when I woke up, everything was still just “delivered.” No replies. Just silence.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Of course it hurts… but this time, it hurts deeper. My heart feels heavier than ever. Maybe my friend was right all along I shouldn’t have walked away. Maybe now I finally understand what she must’ve felt when I asked for space. And realizing that is tearing me apart.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I know now I still have a lot of growing to do. Maybe I’m not yet mature enough for everything I want to handle. Because all I seem to do is hurt her, even if I never mean to. I’m so disappointed in myself that sometimes, even when the tears start falling, they don’t feel like enough. I feel like I’m running out of ways to cry.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe I’ll give it one or two more weeks. I’ll keep sending her songs. One voice message at a time, not to force her to come back, but just to make her smile again… even if she never replies. But if she still doesn’t, then maybe it’s time. I’ll let go.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Letting go will hurt more than anything ever has. But I’ll run to my mother, hug her tight, and cry everything I’ve been carrying. Because after all this, I still don’t know what I’d do without her. I’ve been trying so hard to be the best man I can be but right now, I’m just a mess.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And maybe all I can really do… is cry.
            </p>
