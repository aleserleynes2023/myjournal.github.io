            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Despite everything that has happened, I still choose to initiate. I still choose to reach out.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe I’m doing this because I’m starting to heal… and starting to understand what needs to be done. Maybe it’s because I know that as the man in this relationship, I also carry a responsibility to lead with love, patience, and growth. I may not know everything, but I’ve always been willing to learn. Willing to become better for her.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe that’s the beauty of forgiving and learning to move on. When you love someone, you love them not just in their best moments, but also through their imperfections and mistakes because no one is perfect. Love isn’t about finding someone flawless; it’s about choosing to grow with someone. And as long as we both grow and mature, we’ll be able to build a kingdom together a future that’s peaceful, strong, and truly ours.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And even through the doubts, the silences, and the spaces between us I still choose to care.
            </p>
