            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Should I still continue hoping? <br>
                Should I still continue hurting myself?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I‚Äôm confused. Deeply. <br>
                I know I‚Äôm not in the right place emotionally or mentally to make decisions that could shape my future‚Ä¶ decisions I might regret. <br>
                But right now, I‚Äôm tired. Just tired.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                From the beginning, all I ever wanted was to love her in the way I knew how to be there, to be consistent, to be sincere.
                But somewhere along the way, I started believing that maybe I ruin everything I touch. That maybe I‚Äôm not meant to be loved the way I love.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Am I destined to be alone? <br>
                Am I meant to die alone? <br>
                Will I always feel this‚Ä¶ unseen?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I don‚Äôt know anymore.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                It‚Äôs hard to cry out what‚Äôs in my heart. It‚Äôs even harder when I feel like no one is truly listening. <br>
                All I want‚Ä¶ is to be myself again. <br>
                To be that carefree kid who laughed without heaviness in his chest, who dreamed without fear, who believed in goodness without needing to fight for it every day.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                If there‚Äôs one last wish I could hold onto, it‚Äôs this: <br>
                One day I'll sacrifice my life for a greater good, maybe save the people that mean a lot to me <br>
                And when the time comes for me to go, may I have lived a life worthy enough to be written in the Book of Life <br>
                A life where I fulfilled what God asked of me, <br>
                Even if I was breaking while doing it, The Great Hero.
            </p>
