            <h2>Nights I Wake Missing Her</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I often find myself waking up in the middle of the night somewhere between 12:00 and 2:00 a.m.and without even thinking, 
                the first thing I do is check my phone. Just hoping… maybe there’s a message from her. But most of the time, there’s nothing. 
                And if I’m being honest, it tears me apart more than I care to admit.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                That’s when the thoughts start creeping in. All the overthinking. I just lie there, staring at the ceiling or into the darkness of my room, 
                questioning my choices, replaying moments, wondering where I went wrong or what I should’ve done differently.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Sometimes I wish it wasn’t long-distance. I wish she lived just a few minutes away from my hometown. 
                I wish I had the chance to court her in person bring her flowers, take her on spontaneous dates, and simply be there. 
                Physically. Emotionally. Every day.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                But life isn’t a beautiful fantasy where everything goes your way. I understand that. 
                Maybe this is all happening for a reason God’s test, perhaps? Still, I hate how often she’s the first thing that comes to mind every day. 
                I wonder: even when she’s busy, does she ever think of me too? Does she know how it feels to wait in silence, 
                hoping for even just a single hello that could ease the weight I carry?
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                A simple message. A short conversation to ask how we’ve both been. That’s all it would take to turn this heavy feeling around.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And strangely enough, the more distant things feel between us, the deeper I fall for her. It’s confusing, overwhelming and sometimes, hard to carry. 
                But I guess that’s the thing with real love… it doesn't vanish just because things get hard.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I don’t even know how to put all these thoughts into one clean paragraph. But I’m glad I started this journal. 
                Somehow, it’s helping me unload the weight I can’t express anywhere else. It’s helping me heal slowly and reflect.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                So here I am, again. Writing for her. Writing for myself.
            </p>
