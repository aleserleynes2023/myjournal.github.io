            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Dear Journal,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Maybe… with the help of God, I can endure all of this pain without having to carry it alone.<br>
                Maybe it’s time I truly surrender every thought, every emotion, every weight that’s been crushing my heart. I need to hand it over to Him, because I know I can't do this by my strength anymore.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                I’m beginning to realize something now: I should stop expecting things in return for what I give.<br>
                Love doesn’t keep a score. Care doesn’t demand recognition. I’ve been forcing so much, hoping for something to go my way when maybe the real answer is learning to let go.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Whatever happens… happens.<br>
                And if the path ahead means sacrifice, then maybe that’s what I need to do not out of weakness, but out of love. Not to lose myself, but to finally find peace in knowing I tried, and I loved, without conditions.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Lord, please guide me. I’m letting go not of the love I carry but of the weight I’ve held too long. Help me trust in Your plan more than my own.
            </p>
